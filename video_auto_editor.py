video_auto_editor.py
=====================

Bulk pipeline that, for every input video:

  1. DETECTS the intro and outro (branded opener / end card, credits, outro CTA)
     and cuts them off both ends.
  2. SPLITS everything in between into consecutive N-second PARTS (default 60s).
     A 3-minute video with no intro/outro becomes 3 x 1-minute part files,
     automatically -- no manual math needed. This is the key difference from
     a single-clip tool: every video can produce MULTIPLE output files.
  3. REMOVES a static logo/watermark/credit-text region (if present), baked
     into the same encode.
  4. OPTIMIZES every output part (resolution/bitrate cap + faststart) so the
     final files are small and fast-loading, in the same encode pass as the
     intro/outro trim and the watermark removal -- no separate re-encode step.

Works on a single video OR a whole folder of videos in one command (batch mode
is also what you want if many videos share the same intro/outro/logo, since it
can detect those once instead of guessing per-file).

v3 CHANGES (why some videos kept their watermark / got skipped)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Watermark detection (now fully per-video and adaptive):
  * Sensitivity LADDER (strict -> lenient) instead of one fixed threshold.
  * Usable window analysed as a whole AND in up to 4 time segments, merged --
    catches credits/logos that only appear for part of the video.
  * Every candidate is validated (edges persist inside the box, clearly
    stronger than just outside it) so lenient rungs don't false-trigger.
  * Canny thresholds adapt to each video's brightness.
  * Removal padding is per-axis (long thin credit lines no longer balloon into
    huge boxes that failed the area cap and were silently dropped).
  * Strongly-persistent boxes get relaxed size/edge caps; weak ones stay strict.
  * Batch: per-video detection ALWAYS runs first. If it finds nothing, the
    position that recurs across the batch is used ONLY after being verified in
    that video's own pixels (edges + temporal-median check for faint overlays).
    --shared-watermark-from-first is now just a fallback source for that check.
  * After rendering, the box is re-measured; if the overlay is still visible
    the part is re-rendered with a 1.35x then 1.8x larger region.
Skips fixed:
  * Video discovery is case-insensitive and covers more formats (.MP4, .m4v, .ts...).
  * a.mp4 and a.mov no longer overwrite each other.
  * Short clips (< --two-part-min-sec) become one part instead of 0 parts.
  * If intro/outro trimming leaves < 2s, the trims are ignored and the whole video is used.
  * Detector crashes fall back to "no intro/outro/watermark" instead of killing the video.
  * Per-region delogo failures drop only that region, not all watermark removal.
  * Frame sampling falls back to ffmpeg when OpenCV seeking fails on odd files.
  * End-of-run REPORT lists every video, parts written, watermark source, and the reason for anything skipped or not removed.

v4 CHANGES (retries; bigger removal area)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Intro/outro detection now RETRIES up to 3x per video: each attempt scans a longer
    window (x1.7, x2.5) with a more sensitive scene-cut threshold (0.35 -> 0.28 -> 0.22).
    Outro retries also look at a bigger share of the video and add a little more safety margin.
  * After each first/last part is rendered it is re-checked; any leftover black/colour
    bumper/fade at the start or end is trimmed and the part re-rendered.
  * Watermark/logo/credit detection RETRIES with a progressively WIDER search area
    (edge band 0.32 -> 0.45 -> 0.60 of the frame, smaller minimum mark, larger maximum
    block) x 4 sensitivity levels (one extra very-faint level added).
  * Removal box is slightly bigger by default (padding 8% of width / 25% of height),
    and if the overlay is still visible after rendering, re-rendered at 1.35x, 1.8x, 2.4x.
  * The REPORT shows which retry succeeded and anything still not removed.

v5 CHANGES (GitHub Actions / sitesdo_videos.py pipeline)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * --report-json PATH : machine-readable per-video report (clips, intro/outro cut, watermark boxes,
    "still visible" / "not found" flags, notes). sitesdo_videos.py turns it into the job summary.
  * --time-budget-min N : soft limit; no new video is started after N minutes, the rest are reported
    as "deferred" (the pipeline retries them next run) so the job never times out with nothing uploaded.
  * --max-retry-renders N : caps extra re-renders per video (bigger delogo box / extra trim).
  * Watermark detection decodes its frames once and shares them across all segments/retries (fast on long videos).
  * Retry results for intro/outro can never trim more than 25% of the video (max 60s), and a scan window
    that is "static" from its very first sample is no longer mistaken for an end card.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK ANSWERS TO WHAT YOU ASKED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bulk / batch, split each long video into multiple N-second parts, strip
intro+outro+logo, all in one command:

    python video_auto_editor.py --mode batch --batch ./videos_in --outdir ./videos_out \
        --clip-seconds 60 --shared-watermark-from-first

Single video into multiple parts (e.g. a 3-min video -> three 1-min parts):

    python video_auto_editor.py --input movie.mp4 --output out.mp4 --clip-seconds 60

    -> writes out_part01.mp4, out_part02.mp4, out_part03.mp4 automatically
       (it only writes a single out.mp4 with no suffix if just one part fits)

If you don't want splitting -- just ONE clip like before -- add --single-clip.

SHORT VIDEOS (usable window smaller than --clip-seconds): by default this
now produces TWO EQUAL-LENGTH parts covering the whole usable window instead
of 0 parts. E.g. a 1:50 video with a 60s --clip-seconds request, whose usable
window (after intro/outro trim) is 48s, becomes two ~24s parts rather than
nothing. This only kicks in when a single full clip-length part wouldn't
fit at all. Control it with:

    --two-part-fallback / --no-two-part-fallback   (default: ON)
    --two-part-min-sec 10                          (minimum usable seconds
                                                       required before we'll
                                                       bother splitting into
                                                       two -- below this, the
                                                       leftover is considered
                                                       unusable and skipped)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WATERMARK / CREDIT-TEXT DETECTION (rewritten to be size-adaptive)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real credit lines and logo bumpers vary a LOT in how much of the frame they
actually cover -- a short "HD video on X" line one time, a wide multi-word
credit block another time, at different opacities. A single fixed pixel/
threshold guess was either too tight (clipping letters) or too loose
(eating real picture) depending on the video. Detection now works in three
stages instead of one fixed pass:

  1. SIGNAL: for every sampled pixel, compute two per-pixel scores across
     all sampled frames --
       - "opaque" score: how often that pixel has an edge (Canny) AND how
         LOW its brightness variance is across samples (persistent, static
         logos/text sit still frame to frame).
       - "transparent overlay" score: how often that pixel has an edge,
         restricted to a border band around the frame -- catches
         semi-transparent overlays whose underlying pixel color still
         shifts with the video, so the opaque/low-variance test alone
         would miss them.
     The two are combined by taking the max per pixel, so one pass now
     catches both opaque logos AND semi-transparent text lines.

  2. ADAPTIVE CUTOFF: instead of a fixed magic threshold, Otsu's method
     picks the cutoff automatically FOR THIS VIDEO's actual signal
     strength, so faint/small overlays and bold/large ones both get a
     sensible cutoff instead of one hardcoded number that only worked for
     one contrast level.

  3. REGION GROWING: after finding a rough blob, the bounding box is grown
     outward on all 4 sides while pixel density just outside the box stays
     above a floor, and stops the moment it doesn't. This is the actual fix
     for "sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller" -- the box organically
     settles on the true extent of the credit/logo for THIS video instead
     of relying on one fixed cluster-gap guess. A runaway safety cap
     prevents it from ballooning into unrelated picture content.

If AUTO detection still isn't landing on your credit text, you have two more
reliable options:

  1. Check what it WOULD remove before committing to a whole batch:

        python video_auto_editor.py --input movie.mp4 --debug-preview

     This writes movie_wm_preview.png with a red box around whatever region
     will actually be delogo'd (detected OR manually specified), so you can
     verify alignment on one frame before rendering anything. Add
     --debug-detect to also print the scoring math to the terminal.

  2. Skip detection entirely and specify the exact region yourself, either
     in fixed pixels (same box on every video -- use this if all your
     videos share one resolution):

        --watermark-box 1200,880,700,180        # x,y,w,h in pixels

     ...or as PERCENTAGES of the frame (use this if videos have different
     resolutions but the credit sits in the same relative spot on all of
     them -- this is the more "dynamic" option for a mixed-resolution batch):

        --watermark-box-pct 0.62,0.80,0.35,0.12   # x,y,w,h as fractions 0-1

If your intros or outros are getting confused with content in the MIDDLE of
the video (e.g. on-screen text or a scene change partway through getting
mistaken for an intro/outro boundary), note that detection is hard-capped:
it only ever looks at the first 15s (intro) and last 15s (outro) of the
video by default. Raise --intro-max-search / --outro-max-search if your
real intro/outro genuinely runs longer than that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTRO DETECTION (rewritten to catch fades, dissolves, and CTA overlays,
not just hard black-frame gaps)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outros vary just as much as intros -- some cut hard to a black frame, some
slowly dim/dissolve into black over a few seconds, some cross-fade into a
mostly-static "subscribe" card or solid-color end card, and some are a
semi-transparent overlay that fades in on top of the still-playing video.
A single black-frame check missed all but the first case. Outro detection
now runs several checks over the trailing window (last 15s by default) and
takes the EARLIEST boundary any of them find, since that earliest point is
where the real content actually stops and the outro material begins:

  - black_frame_gap    : a run of near-black frames near the end (hard cut
                          to black, or credits over black).
  - color_bumper_outro  : the video ends on a frame dominated by one solid
                          hue (a flat-color end card / bumper), walked
                          backward to find where that color took over.
  - static_card_outro   : the last few frames are nearly motionless (a
                          still end-card or CTA overlay), walked backward
                          to find where the video stopped changing.
  - fade_to_black_outro : brightness ramps down toward black by the very
                          end even without ever fully triggering the
                          black-frame threshold -- a slow dissolve/offset
                          into darkness -- walked backward to where the dim
                          started.
  - scene_cut           : fallback -- the strongest hard scene change in
                          the window, if none of the above match.

On top of whichever boundary is found, a SAFETY MARGIN (default 2s) is
subtracted so the cut lands a couple of seconds BEFORE the detected outro
material, not right at its first frame -- this is what removes the last
bit of "real" content that's already mid-transition (fading, offsetting,
dimming) into the outro, instead of leaving a few frames of that dissolve
in the usable part. Tune it with:

    --outro-safety-margin 3     # strip 3s before the detected outro start
                                   (default 2, sensible range 1-5)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT QUALITY / OPTIMIZATION (quality-first, on by default)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2 FIX: the old defaults (640px longest side + a hard 1.5 Mbps target with a
1-second buffer) were the main reason output looked soft/blurry: a 1080p
source was shrunk to 640px and then starved of bits on every busy scene.
Output is now a CONSTANT-QUALITY (CRF) encode with a bitrate CEILING, so easy
scenes stay small and hard scenes get the bits they need:

    --max-dim 1920           # longest side in px (default 1920 -> 1080p
                                landscape AND 1080x1920 portrait are kept at
                                full size; only bigger sources are shrunk)
    --crf 20                 # quality: lower = sharper/bigger (default 20;
                                18 = near-lossless, 23 = smaller files)
    --video-bitrate 6M       # bitrate CEILING (maxrate), not a target
                                (60s @ 6M is ~45 MB; lower it to shrink files)
    --audio-bitrate 128k     # audio bitrate
    --encode-preset medium   # ffmpeg -preset (slower = sharper per byte)
    --no-optimize            # no downscale and no bitrate ceiling at all
                                (CRF 18 at source size)

Smaller/faster files for a quick test:  --max-dim 1280 --crf 23 --video-bitrate 3M

WATERMARK SAFETY (v2): delogo *blurs/smears* whatever region it is pointed
at, so a wrong or oversized box shows up as a soft patch in the picture.
Auto-detected boxes are now rejected if they are too big, sit in the centre
of the frame, or add up to too much of the frame:

    --watermark-max-area-pct 6     # per-region cap (default 6% of the frame)
    --watermark-total-area-pct 10  # all regions together (default 10%)
    --watermark-allow-center       # allow boxes away from the frame edges

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPEED (parallel rendering)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ffmpeg encodes are independent processes, so both axes of this pipeline can
run concurrently instead of one-clip-at-a-time:

    --part-workers 3   # render this many PARTS of the SAME video at once
    --workers 2         # batch mode: process this many VIDEOS at once

Each ffmpeg process itself uses multiple CPU threads for the encode, so
keep (workers * part-workers) modest relative to your core count -- e.g. on
an 8-core machine, --workers 2 --part-workers 2 is a reasonable start.

# they DO have in common with every logo-bumper style is that the opening is
# essentially STATIC: frame-to-frame it barely changes (maybe a little
# shimmer or a slow rotation) until it cuts or fades into real, moving
# footage. This checks for that directly: confirm the first few sampled
# frames are nearly identical to each other (so we know it's really a
# static card, not real motion from frame 0), then find the first point
# where the frame has drifted away from that opening reference. Comparing
# against the ORIGINAL reference frame (not just the previous sample) means
# this also catches slow fades/dissolves that a consecutive-frame scene-cut
# check would miss, since the cumulative drift still crosses the threshold
# even when no single step between adjacent samples looks like a hard cut.

    whatever it actually is (a small corner mark or a large multi-line
    caption) rather than a fixed guess, and without assuming there's only
    one watermark element on screen.

    Pipeline:
      1. Sample frames across [start_sec, end_sec] and compute, per pixel:
         - edge_freq: how often Canny finds an edge there.
         - var_norm : normalized brightness variance across samples.
      2. Combine two scores per pixel and take the max:
         - "opaque"      = edge_freq * (1 - var_norm)   (persistent + static)
         - "transparent" = edge_freq, restricted to a border band around the
           frame (catches alpha-blended overlays whose underlying color
           still shifts with the video, so variance alone can't flag them).
      3. Threshold the combined map with Otsu's method (adaptive per video).
      4. Cluster nearby blobs with a SMALL merge gap (bridges gaps between
         letters/words of the same credit line without also bridging
         unrelated far-away edge noise into the same box). Any blob that
         still ends up spanning most of the frame is re-split on the raw
         mask with plain connected components, and anything letterbox- or
         progress-bar-shaped (spans almost the full width or height while
         staying very thin) is dropped outright.
      5. Each survivor must also clear a DENSITY FLOOR (the fraction of
         "on" pixels inside its own bounding box) -- this is what lets the
         area cap be generous (real captions/watermark blocks can be a
         large, legitimate chunk of the frame) without that generosity
         being exploited by a big, sparse, accidentally-bridged region:
         genuine text/graphics are locally dense wherever they sit, sparse
         bridging noise is not.
      6. Merge nearby survivors (e.g. a logo icon stacked beside its own
         credit-text line) using a gap bounded by the smaller piece's own
         scale, so this can reunite one watermark's parts without reaching
         across the frame to grab something unrelated.
      7. Region-grow each surviving region outward until density drops off,
         with a cap scaled to how big it already is (a tiny mark stays
         tightly capped; a block that's already large is allowed to keep
         growing further) and a hard final ceiling either way; if growth
         somehow still runs away, that region reverts to its pre-growth
         box rather than shipping something oversized.
      8. Keep at most `max_regions` regions, ranked by density + corner/edge
         proximity + size, so a video with one tiny corner logo still gets
         exactly one region while one with both a caption block AND a
         separate logo gets both.

    Callers should pass `start_sec`/`end_sec` as the USABLE window (i.e.
    already past the intro and before the outro) so a black-screen intro
    never gets sampled here.
